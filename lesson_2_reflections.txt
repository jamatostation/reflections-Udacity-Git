What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I believe this asigns a tracking system to the files like the dewey decimal system. We need it so git knows what it is working with.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to setup your commits effectively without a gui.
