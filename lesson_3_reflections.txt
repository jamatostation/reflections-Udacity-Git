When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ALWAYS! Isn't that the beauty of computers? Access your work wherever you want.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You could be working on a different version as someone that recently added a change that you do not want.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks for when you are collaborating on something someone else started.
clones for anything that involves having naother version of something.
branches for maintaining multiple versions of something.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

maintaining continuity between them. making tracking easier and making it easy to see the whole picture when coding.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate with a file share service. The pro would be the lack of a learning curve. The con would be that it would be almost impossible to stay organized with any number of non superficial tasks.
