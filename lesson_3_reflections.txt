When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ALWAYS! Isn't that the beauty of computers? Access your work wherever you want.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You could be working on a different version as someone that recently added a change that you do not want.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks for when you are collaborating on something someone else started.
clones for anything that involves having naother version of something.
branches for maintaining multiple versions of something.
