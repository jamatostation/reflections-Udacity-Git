When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ALWAYS! Isn't that the beauty of computers? Access your work wherever you want.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You could be working on a different version as someone that recently added a change that you do not want.
